=>=> Access modifiers decide who can use what inside a class.
=>=> In simple words: 👉 They control visibility of data and functions.

=>=> There are only 3:

1. public
Anyone can access it
Think: open to all.

2. private
Only the class itself can access it
Think: personal diary.

3. protected
Data and methods are accessible inside class and to its derived class
Class + its child classes can access it


=>=> Best memory line:

public = everyone
private = only me
protected = me + my children
