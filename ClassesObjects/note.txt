=>=> Class
Class = blueprint (design) of a thing
Like:
A car design on paper — not a real car yet.
It only defines:
• what data it will have
• what actions it can do

...................................................

=>=> Object
Object = real thing made from the class
Like:
The actual car built using the design.
