This pointer:-
this = pointer that holds the address of the current object.

Even simpler:
👉 this refers to the object that is calling the function.

Why it is needed
When class variables and function parameters have the same name, C++ gets confused.
this removes that confusion.

Without this:
❌ salary = salary; (parameter assigns to itself)

With this:
✅ object’s salary gets the value

One-line rule (remember this)
this->variable means “this object’s variable”.
