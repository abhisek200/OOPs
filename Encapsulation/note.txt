=> ENCAPSULATION:- 
   wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

=> One-line definition (remember this):-
   Encapsulation = data hiding + controlled access in a class

=> Quick check:
   If a class has:-

   ✔ private data
   ✔ public getter/setter (controlled access in a class)

   → You are using encapsulation.
